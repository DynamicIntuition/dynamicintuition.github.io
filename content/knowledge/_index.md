ðŸ‘‹ Hello! This is the knowledge base for PLRC software projects.

 In general, this is not documentation! We like to use language- or registry-specific media for those purposes. Everything that cannot be comfortably put there (or that could or should change faster than code) goes here.

## Order

We organize everything by project. There is no strict correspondence between projects and software repositories/packages. Therefore, one project could have many (or no) repositories or packages, but how each project organizes itself is very much subject to being under that project's section.


Apart from that, we keep some meta-information such as this page. An important one is the yearly strategic plan we make for our projects, which you can find [here](/knowledge/strategy).
